DISTANCE(BillingAddress, GEOLOCATION(37.775,-122.418), 'mi') < 20 in soql where clause.
Read and set geolocation field components by appending “__latitude__s” or “__longitude__s” to the field name, instead of the usual “__c.”
eg :myObject__c.aLocation__latitude__s;
compound fields cant be used in visualforce,dataloader export , can’t access or set value.
Custom geolocation and location fields on standard addresses aren’t supported with email templates.

DISTANCE(warehouse_location__c, GEOLOCATION(37.775,-122.418), 'km') works
DISTANCE(GEOLOCATION(37.775,-122.418), warehouse_location__c, 'km') doesn’t work.
Apex bind variables aren’t supported for the units parameter in the DISTANCE function.
[SELECT ID, Name, BillingLatitude FROM Account WHERE DISTANCE(My_Location_Field__c, GEOLOCATION(10,10), :units) < 10]; dont work 

The GEOLOCATION function returns a location data type that can be used only by, and must be used with, the DISTANCE function. The GEOLOCATION function doesn’t work on its own.
