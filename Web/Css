CSS is case-sensitive 
font-family : FAMILY_NAME,GENERIC NAME;
  //eg: font-family: Lobster , "Open Sans"
font-size:27px; 
font-weight:200; // thickness
line-height:25px; // vertical spacing between lines

.thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 10px;
  }
to make circular : {
    border-radius: 50%;
}
style of Id > Style of class .

padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border
margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements. 
If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.

if margin is  positive shirnk inside the div
if margin is negative grow inside or outside the div.

padding : top right bottom left;
margin : top right bottom left ; // margin : 40px 20px 20px 40px;
The two main types of length units are absolute and relative.
Absolute units tie to physical units of length. 
For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, 

Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. 
For example, em is based on the size of an element's font.
If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.

overriding styles: 
if a body has css , and element has seperate css -> elements css will be applied.

if elements has 2 css class -> then the one which is declared last in css will be applied.
->the browser will look at the declaration order and not the order of their use!

if elements has id and css associated with id -> that will have more precedence and applied.

if there is any inline style that will be applied even if id are css class is there.

.pink-text {
    color: pink !important;
}
this css will be applied no matter inline, or id is specified. !important take higher precendence.

CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. 
For example, #000000 - black.
we can create over 16 million other colors!

we can reduce the 6 digits to 3 . 1 for each RGB.
we can create over 4000 colors.
#FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.

color : rbg(255,0,255);

css varible : 

--penguin-skin : pink;

usage:
body : var(--penguin-skin,black); black will be applied if variable is not found(it should be exact match)

Internet Explorer will ignore CSS variable because it does not support CSS variables.
workaround: declare a know way to set style , one line before css variable usage.
background:red;
background:var(--red-text);

CSS variables are inherited, just like ordinary properties.

:root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html element.
if u decalre a css variable in root , it will be avaialble globally.

if u again declared css var in child elements , that will be applied.

media Query : 
@media (max-width: 350px) {
:root{

}
}// if the max width is below 350 px, css variable declred inside this will be used.
else the matching media query root css declared variable will be used.

background-color:rgba(45,45,45,0.1); -> change color and give opacity as well.

shadow : 
box-shadow:offset-x offset-y blur-radius(optional) spread-radius(optional) color 
box-shadow:0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.9)
can have multiple comma seperated shadows.

Opacity : 0.7 ; 

text-transform:uppercase;
lowercase , uppercase , capitalize, initial, inherit(use same as parent) , none;

A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors,
in order to select a specific state of the element.

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

When the position of an element is set to relative, 
it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. 
It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom.

Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow
 - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.

h1 {
    position: relative:
    top:10 px;   // push element 10 px towards down
    bottom:10 px;   // push element 10 px towards up
    left:10 px;   // push element 10 px towards right
    right:10 px;   // push element 10 px towards left
}

position property is absolute, 
which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. 

absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor.

absolute removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it.

 If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;),
 the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

fixed position similar to absolute , but wont move when we scroll.

Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning: 
.navBar{
      position:fixed;
      top:0px;
      left:0px;
}

Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and 
pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. 
It's commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.

#left {
      float:left;
      width: 50%;
}
#right {
      float:right;
      width: 40%;
}

z-index: whole number , bring elements up the stacks.

Center the div on the page :
div {
    margin:auto;
}

css gradiant:
background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

code for danger board background color : 
    background: repeating-linear-gradient(
      45deg,
      yellow 0px,
      yellow 40px,
      black 40px,
      black 80px
    );

pattern for background : 
background:url("https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/MJAkxbh.png");

Increase the size of the element:
 transform: scale(1.5); // use it on  containers like div to make it big

on hover increase the element size : 
div:hover{
    transform:scale(1.1);
}

 skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.
 transform:skewX(25deg);
 transform:skewY(25deg);
 //90 degree gone , 180 - same as it is.

background-color: transparent; // removes the color 

crescent moon : 
  .center {
    position: absolute;
    margin: auto;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: transparent;
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: 25px 10px 0px 0px blue;
  }

::before and ::after pseudo-elements. 
These pseudo-elements are used to add something before or after a selected element.
.heart::before {   //.heart::after
    content: "" ;
    background-color: pink;
    position: absolute;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    top: -25px;
    left: 0px;
  }

Animation :

#rect {
animation-name: rainbow;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}

@keyframes rainbow {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: green;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
    left : 25px; use offset to move elemts during animation
  }
}

have the style applied when animation ends : 
animation-name: rainbow;
animation-duration: 4s;
animation-fill-mode:forwards; //wont reset it back
animation-iteration-count:infinite;//or 3


transform: scale(1) rotate(-45deg);

same animation which is going infinite but varialbe rates :
.stars {
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }

.star-1 {
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }

.star-2 {
    animation-duration: 9s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }
<div class="star-1 stars"></div>

how the animation happems over a time : 
animation-timing-function : ease;ease-out;linear;ease-in;
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75); / use this for more finer control

animation value for juggling ball: 
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.311, 0.441, 0.444, 1.649);


CSS Flexbox:
Placing the CSS property display: flex; 
on an element allows you to use other flex properties to build a responsive page.

adding display : flex ; will make it alligned as a row.
The default value for the flex-direction property is row.

flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: row-reverse;
flex-direction: column-reverse;

justify-content:center;
justify-content:flex-start;
justify-content:flex-end;
justify-content:space-between;
justify-content:space-around;
justify-content:space-evenly;

justify-content property aligned flex items along the main axis
align-items property to align flex items along the cross axis. 
a row, it tells CSS how to push the items in the entire row up or down within the container. 
And for a column, how to push all the items left or right within the container.

with respect to row:
justify-content  > left to right : 
align - items  > top down  : 

align-items - baseline (like underline)
align-items - stretch
align-items - flex-end
align-items - flex-start
align-items - center

flex-wrap - extra items move into a new row or column.
flex-wrap:wrap;
flex-wrap:wrap-reverse;

flex-shrink wil shrink the flex items : 
more the value more it will shrink :
flex-shrink : 2 ;

The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property.
flex-grow : 1;

The flex-basis property specifies the initial size of the item 
before CSS makes adjustments with flex-shrink or flex-grow.

flex-basis:10em;

shorthand : 
flex : flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis
flex: 0 1 auto;
flex:2 2 150px;

order property is used to tell CSS the order of how flex items appear in the flex container
order:1;

align-self. This property allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually,
align-self override align-items.
align-self:flex-end;
align-self:center; // accept all parameters as align-items
